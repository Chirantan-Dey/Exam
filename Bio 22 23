Okay, let's break down this second exam paper (BE-III/BSC-BS-301/22) and outline how to approach each question for a comprehensive answer.

**Group-A**

**Question 1: (2.5+2.5)+(2.5+2.5)+(2.5+2.5)+(2.5+2.5)=20**

**(a) Define gene and chromosome.**

*   **Gene:** A heritable unit of information that codes for a functional product (e.g., a protein or an RNA molecule). It is a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA.
*   **Chromosome:** A thread-like structure composed of DNA and proteins (histones) that carries genetic information in the form of genes. It becomes visible during cell division.

**(b) Define saprotrophic and holotrophic nutrition.**

*   **Saprotrophic Nutrition:** A mode of nutrition in which organisms obtain nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter. They secrete enzymes to break down the organic matter externally and then absorb the products.  (Example: Fungi, some bacteria)
*   **Holotrophic Nutrition:** A mode of nutrition in which organisms ingest solid or liquid food and then digest it internally. This is the characteristic of animals.  (Example: Humans, animals)

**(c) Define unicellular and multicellular organisms with examples.**

*   **Unicellular Organism:** An organism consisting of a single cell. All life processes occur within that one cell. (Example: Bacteria, yeast, amoeba)
*   **Multicellular Organism:** An organism composed of many cells that are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems. (Example: Humans, plants, animals)

**(d) Classify the proteins along with their examples.**

*   **Classification of Proteins:**

    *   **Structural Proteins:** Provide support and shape (e.g., collagen, keratin)
    *   **Enzymes:** Catalyze biochemical reactions (e.g., amylase, lipase)
    *   **Transport Proteins:** Carry molecules (e.g., hemoglobin, albumin)
    *   **Hormones:** Chemical messengers (e.g., insulin, growth hormone)
    *   **Antibodies (Immunoglobulins):** Defend against foreign substances (e.g., IgG, IgM)
    *   **Contractile Proteins:** Involved in movement (e.g., actin, myosin)
    *   **Storage Proteins:** Store nutrients (e.g., ferritin, casein)

**Group-B**

**Question 2: 5+2+3=10**

**(a) Explain the Watson-Crick model of DNA with a proper figure.**

*   **Watson-Crick Model:**
    *   **Double Helix:** DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands wound around each other in a double helix.
    *   **Antiparallel:** The two strands run in opposite directions (5' to 3' and 3' to 5').
    *   **Base Pairing:** Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).
    *   **Hydrogen Bonds:** The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds (two between A and T, three between G and C).
    *   **Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:** The sugar and phosphate groups form the backbone of each strand.
    *   **Major and Minor Grooves:** The double helix has major and minor grooves due to the helical twist.
*   **Figure:** A diagram of the double helix showing the base pairing, sugar-phosphate backbone, and the 5' and 3' ends.

**(b) What do you mean by complementarity of base pairs in DNA.**

*   **Complementarity:** In DNA, complementarity refers to the specific base pairing between adenine (A) and thymine (T), and between guanine (G) and cytosine (C). This means that for every A on one strand, there is a T on the opposite strand, and for every G, there is a C. This ensures that the DNA double helix is stable and that the genetic information can be accurately replicated.

**(c) Explain the Chargaff’s rule.**

*   **Chargaff's Rules:**
    *   The amount of adenine (A) is equal to the amount of thymine (T) in DNA: [A] = [T]
    *   The amount of guanine (G) is equal to the amount of cytosine (C) in DNA: [G] = [C]
    *   The total amount of purines (A + G) is equal to the total amount of pyrimidines (T + C): [A + G] = [T + C]

*   **Transcription:** The process of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template.
*   **Roles of RNA types:**
    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes for protein synthesis.
    *   **tRNA (transfer RNA):** Carries amino acids to the ribosomes for protein synthesis, matching the anticodon on the tRNA to the codon on the mRNA.
    *   **rRNA (ribosomal RNA):** Forms the structural and functional components of ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis.

**(b) Define enzyme. Explain the factors that affect the enzyme activity.**

*   **Enzyme:**  A biological catalyst that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the reaction.

    *   **Temperature:** Enzymes have an optimal temperature range.

    *   *Saturation:* Fats are generally saturated (containing primarily saturated fatty acids), while oils are generally unsaturated (containing primarily unsaturated fatty acids).

**(b) Explain the formation process of a polypeptide chain.**

*   **Polypeptide Chain Formation:** The formation of a polypeptide chain occurs during translation at the ribosome.

    1.  *Initiation:* Ribosome binds to mRNA, and the first tRNA brings the starting amino acid (usually methionine) to the ribosome.
    2.  *Elongation:*
        *   *Codon Recognition:* The next tRNA, carrying the appropriate amino acid, binds to the A site of the ribosome, based on the mRNA codon.
        *   *Peptide Bond Formation:* An enzyme (peptidyl transferase) catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids.
        *   *Translocation:* The ribosome moves one codon down the mRNA, shifting the tRNA in the A site to the P site, and the tRNA in the P site to the E site (where it exits).
    3.  *Termination:*  The ribosome reaches a stop codon on the mRNA. Release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the polypeptide chain to be released.

**(c) Mention the biological functions of lipids.**

*   **Energy Storage:** Triglycerides are the major form of energy storage in the body.
*   **Structural Components:** Phospholipids are the main components of cell membranes.
