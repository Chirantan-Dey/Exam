Okay, let's break down the exam questions based on the OCR output. I'll provide outlines and essential concepts for each question, to help create thorough answers.

**Group A**

**Question 1: (4+5+5+5)**

**(a) Define Replication. Explain about the core materials of the replication.**

*   **Define Replication:** Replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule.
*   **Core Materials:**
    *   **DNA Template:** The original DNA strand that serves as a guide for synthesizing the new strand.
    *   **DNA Polymerase:** The primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. It uses the template strand to ensure correct base pairing (A with T, G with C). Different types of DNA polymerases exist with specialized roles.
    *   **Primers:** Short RNA sequences that initiate DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase needs a 3'-OH group to begin adding nucleotides. Primase synthesizes the primers.
    *   **Deoxynucleoside Triphosphates (dNTPs):** The building blocks of DNA (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP). They provide the energy for polymerization.
    *   **Helicase:** Unwinds the double helix to create a replication fork.
    *   **Single-Stranded Binding Proteins (SSBPs):** Stabilize the separated DNA strands to prevent them from re-annealing.
    *   **Topoisomerase:** Relieves the torsional stress ahead of the replication fork by breaking and rejoining DNA strands.
